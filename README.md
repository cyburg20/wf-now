# wf-now


getjobfromdb: this function performs three queries to the db and returns a job in json format.

readxml this reads an xml file and converts it to a jsonfile. I also created an init file so i just called it from the handler with workflowlist.get()

getnode: this function pipes both function. and uses the result to get the exact node the job is at.
